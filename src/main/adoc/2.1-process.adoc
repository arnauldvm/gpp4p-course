General recommendations
-----------------------

* no premature optimization
* must have a performance objective
* should have a workbench (performance test)
* "80-20": concentrate of the 20% of the app that is responsible for 80% of the load
* one issue often hides other issues
* first actions might not show any improvement. +
Yet, don't despair!


Improvement process
-------------------

_(Reminder from JPT course.)_

* run test
* measure
* if performance objective not reached:
** analyse results, look for:
*** first OS contentions,
*** then GC issues,
*** then code optimization
** fix (one at a time!
** iterate (-> run test) (-> run test)


Performance test
----------------

_(Reminder from JPT course.)_

Test data::
* quantity
* properly randomized

Test harness::
* properly isolated
* test in real-life conditions (DB size, # simultaneous users, server sizing...)

Test scenario, load profiles::
* representative of the issue
