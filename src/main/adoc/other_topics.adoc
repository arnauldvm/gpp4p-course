* performance improvement process (see JPT)
** no premature optimization
** have a performance objective
** concentrate of the 20% of the app that is responsible for 80% of the load
** one issue often hides other issues
** first actions might not show any improvement. Yet, don't despair!
** test in real-life conditions (DB size, # simultaneous users, server sizing...)
** OS contention, then GC issues, then code optimization
** ...

* Most frequent sources of performance issues
