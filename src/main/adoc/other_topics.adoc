* performance improvement process (see JPT)
** no premature optimization
** have a performance objective
** concentrate of the 20% of the app that is responsible for 80% of the load
** one issue often hides other issues
** first actions might not show any improvement. Yet, don't despair!
** test in real-life conditions (DB size, # simultaneous users, server sizing...)
** OS contention, then GC issues, then code optimization
** ...

* Most frequent sources of performance issues

** memory, objects lifecycle
*** _See also JPT course_
*** useless allocation/deallocation: try to re-use objects -> consider using object pools
*** big objects in memory (e.g. file transfer -> use streaming)
*** chase memory leaks
*** use SoftReference for long-lived objects
*** difficult: balance memory used vs. performance
**** E.g.: reduce session scope as much as possible => more DB requests!
*** prefer local variables over class variables
*** don't +System.gc()+
*** prefer StringBuilder over '+' or String.format
*** allocate collections/buffers/builders with appropriate initialCapacity
*** avoid allocating objects in loops

** persistence, database
*** avoid useless fetches from DB (beware of ORM)
*** pagination
*** optimize your JPA model, optimize your SQL calls

*** Use +PreparedStatement+, parameters *must* be injected through bind variables
*** use batch mode when applicable
*** avoid multiple joins (highly non-linear!)
*** Use optimistic transactions
*** no autocommit, but keep transactions short (group all DB requests is possible)

** remote services
*** -> use caches for slow services
*** set your timeouts!
*** use async services if you can
*** use connections/clients pool
*** consider using a circuit breaker
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern

** disk I/Os
*** *all* logging frameworks are bad performance-wise -> reduce logging to a strict minimum when in PROD
*** prefer async logging framework
**** NOTE: "security logging" is *not* logging (should be called "security audit trace")
*** generally speaking, avoid writing to disk

** threads contentions
 http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/tips/synchronization.shtml
*** avoid synchronization as much as possible -> consider "Lock-Free (or Lockless) Programming"
 http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/
**** never use +synchronized(this)+
*** even using +volatile+ may be slow
*** beware of Concurrent structures
*** avoid using thread safe classes when not required (e.g. prefer StringBuilder over StringBuffer)!
*** *never* use "exactly-once" QoS for messaging, use:
**** at-most-once if you can afford losing messages
**** at-least-once (+ message numbering) otherwise
*** use async I/O if you can

** architecture
*** prefer many small servers to few big servers

* Less frequent sources of performance issues

** CPU
*** don't use exceptions as return values / for control flow!
*** choose your collections implementations carefully

*** choose your algorithms carefully (e.g. sort...)
*** use market proof algorithms implementations
*** know how your CPU work (e.g. cache levels)
*** favor inlining by the JIT (...)
*** replace Lists and Strings by arrays
*** cryptography is slow
*** XML parsing is slow
*** serializing/deserializing is slow
*** creating a regexp is slow
*** prefer StringBuilder over String.format
*** avoid polling
*** getters/setters may hurt (if not inlined)

* Out-of-scope
** java fat clients performance (AWT, Swing, JavaFX...)
