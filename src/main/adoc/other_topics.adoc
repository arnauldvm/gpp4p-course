** Von Neuman (abstraction, not real anymore)
** real architecture (multi-core, instructions pipelines, cache levels...)
** typical latencies

* performance improvement process (see JPT)
** no premature optimization
** have a performance objective
** concentrate of the 20% of the app that is responsible for 80% of the load
** one issue often hides other issues
** first actions might not show any improvement. Yet, don't despair!
** test in real-life conditions (DB size, # simultaneous users, server sizing...)
** OS contention, then GC issues, then code optimization
** ...

* Most frequent sources of performance issues

** disk I/Os
*** *all* logging frameworks are bad performance-wise -> reduce logging to a strict minimum when in PROD
*** prefer async logging framework
**** NOTE: "security logging" is *not* logging (should be called "security audit trace")
*** generally speaking, avoid writing to disk

** architecture
*** prefer many small servers to few big servers
