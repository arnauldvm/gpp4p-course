Transactions
------------

NOTE: Choose carefully the Jave EE transaction type

Transaction attribute type can have one of the following values:

* +Required+: The existing transaction is re-used.
If there is no existing transaction, a new one is created.
* +RequiresNew+: The container must invoke the enterprise bean method with a new transaction context.
The already existing transaction (if any) is suspended.
* +Mandatory+: If there is no existing transaction, an exception is thrown.
* +NotSupported+: The already existing transaction (if any) is suspended.
The enterprise bean method is invoked without transaction.
* +Supports+: The existing transaction (if any) is re-used.
Else the enterprise bean method is invoked without transaction.
* +Never+: The client is required to call without a transaction context, otherwise an exception is thrown
The enterprise bean method is invoked without transaction.

See http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/TransactionAttributeType.html[Javadoc]

Transactions
------------

NOTE: Use optimistic transactions


[[jpa]]
JPA: Caching
------------

[WARNING]
=====
Shared caching (L2 cache) must be disabled at Smals +
-> check +persistence.xml+ (! default for eclipselink is to enable the shared cache)

Even though it can impact performance negatively!
=====


JPA: Fetch strategies
---------------------

NOTE: Carefully tune +FetchType+: LAZY vs. EAGER.

FYI: defaults:

* for {One,Many}ToOne is *EAGER*,
* for {One,Many}ToMany is *LAZY*

_Example: in Publiato session size 500kB -> 250 kB because of PDF attachment uselessly retrieved by JPA_

* Avoid loading too much data on one end (-> prefer LAZY)
* While avoiding too many queries on the other end (-> prefer EAGER)

-> use fetch joins with LAZY relations to avoid additional queries


JPA: Queries
------------

NOTE: Use (native) queries when retrieving only tiny pieces of data +
pass:[...] to avoid loading whole object tree when only a part of the information is required

_Example: in ePV response time 20s -> 1s because a big object tree was loaded in LAZY mode, just to retrieve one integer_


NOTE: Use bulk mode when updating many entities. +
(Use +CriteriaBuilder+/+CriteriaUpdate+ or +CriteriaDelete+.)

JPA: Entity lifecycle
---------------------

JPA: Entity lifecycle
---------------------

* merge != persist != save
** +merge()+: Merge the state of the given entity into the current persistence context.
The initial entity is not tracked, the new entity is tracked.
** +persist()+: Make an instance managed and persistent.
The entity state is tracked.
** Tracked entity is saved to DB only when Tx is committed
* avoid: flush, refresh
** +flush()+: Synchronize the persistence context to the underlying database. +
Premature queries, potentially useless.
** +refresh()+: Refresh the state of the instance from the database, overwriting changes made to the entity, if any. +
Why would you do that? Better refactor your business logic.


JPA: Data model
---------------

Optimize your JPA model

NOTE: bidirectional relationships must be maintained manually

WARNING: Make sure your data model does not imply O(n) or O(n2) performance


[[sql]]
SQL: Performance comparison
---------------------------

[cols="<5,^2",width="70%"]
|=====
| Test                               | #Users Supported
| No Parsing all statements          | 270
| Soft Parsing all statements        | 150
| Hard Parsing all statements        |  60
| Re-Connecting for each Transaction |  30
|=====

https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/pfgrf_design.htm#TGDBA94122

=> Most time-intensive: connecting > compiling > parsing > executing


SQL: Optimize efficiency
------------------------

[NOTE]
=====
re-use SQL statement -> avoids "soft parsing"

* statements pool
* re-use session => statement retrieved from the session cache
=====

NOTE: Use +PreparedStatement+, parameters *must* be injected through bind variables +
-> avoids "hard parsing": execution plan is retrieved from "shared pool"

[WARNING]
=====
*Never* inject parameters directly in your SQL query string. +
Generally speaking, avoid creating your requests dynamically.

*"query-builder-like" applications are evil*
=====

NOTE: Use connection pools (avoids connection cost)


SQL: Other advices
------------------

* pagination
* use batch mode when applicable
* FULL TABLE SCAN is better than INDEX for small tables
* avoid multiple joins (highly non-linear!)
* no autocommit, but keep transactions short (group all DB requests if possible)
