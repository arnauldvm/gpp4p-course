Other advices
-------------

_(Less frequent sources of performance issues)_

* don't use exceptions as return values / for control flow!
* choose your collections implementations carefully

[cols="h,a,a"]
|=====
| {nbsp} | Single threaded | Concurrent
| Lists	|
* +ArrayList+ – generic array-based
* +LinkedList+ – do not use
* +Vector+ – deprecated
|
* +CopyOnWriteArrayList+ – seldom updated, often traversed
| Queues / deques |
* +ArrayDeque+ – generic array-based
* +Stack+ – deprecated
* +PriorityQueue+ – sorted retrieval operations
|
* +ArrayBlockingQueue+ – bounded blocking queue
* +ConcurrentLinkedDeque+ / ConcurrentLinkedQueue – unbounded linked queue (CAS)
* +DelayQueue+ – queue with delays on each element
* +LinkedBlockingDeque+ / LinkedBlockingQueue – optionally bounded linked queue (locks)
* +LinkedTransferQueue+ – may transfer elements w/o storing
* +PriorityBlockingQueue+ – concurrent PriorityQueue
* +SynchronousQueue+ – Exchanger with Queue interface
| Maps |
* +HashMap+ – generic map
* +EnumMap+ – enum keys
* +Hashtable+ – deprecated
* +IdentityHashMap+ – keys compared with ==
* +LinkedHashMap+ – keeps insertion order
* +TreeMap+ – sorted keys
* +WeakHashMap+ – useful for caches
|
* +ConcurrentHashMap+ – generic concurrent map
* +ConcurrentSkipListMap+ – sorted concurrent map
| Set |
* +HashSet+ – generic set
* +EnumSet+ – set of enums
* +BitSet+ – set of bits/dense integers
* +LinkedHashSet+ – keeps insertion order
* +TreeSet+ – sorted set
|
* +ConcurrentSkipListSet+ – sorted concurrent set
* +CopyOnWriteArraySet+ – seldom updated, often traversed
|=====
* choose your algorithms carefully (e.g. sort...)
* use market proof algorithms implementations
* know how your CPU work (e.g. cache levels)
* favor inlining by the JIT (...)
* replace Lists and Strings by arrays
* cryptography is slow
* XML parsing is slow
* serializing/deserializing is slow
* creating a regexp is slow
* prefer StringBuilder over String.format
* avoid polling
* getters/setters may hurt (if not inlined)


:numbered!:
That's all folks!
